# `@openai/codex-security`

Open-source TypeScript SDK and CLI for running Codex Security scans. The
ESM-only package includes TypeScript declarations, the `codex-security`
executable, and the matching Codex runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> This package follows semantic versioning. Its public API may change between
> minor versions before `1.0.0`.

## Install

```bash
npm install @openai/codex-security
npx @openai/codex-security --version
```

The package supports macOS, Linux, and Windows and requires Node.js 22.13.0 or
later in the 22.x release line, Node.js 24.x, or Node.js 26.x. Scans, bulk
scans, exports, scan history, and saved findings also require Python 3.10 or
later. Python 3.10 also requires `tomli`. Use `--python` with `scan`,
`bulk-scan`, or `export`; use `pythonPath` with the SDK. Set `PYTHON` to select
an interpreter for any Python-backed command.

When a newer version is available, the CLI shows the update command for your
installation method. Set `CODEX_SECURITY_NO_UPDATE_NOTICE=1` to hide the
notice. Notices are also disabled in CI and when stderr is not a terminal.

## Run a scan from TypeScript

Sign in with `npx @openai/codex-security login` or set `OPENAI_API_KEY` or
`CODEX_API_KEY`. Then create a client and scan a repository you own or have
permission to assess:

```ts
import { CodexSecurity } from "@openai/codex-security";

const security = new CodexSecurity();

try {
  const result = await security.run("/path/to/repository", {
    outputDir: "/path/outside/repository/results",
  });

  console.log(result.reportPath);
  console.log(result.findings.findings.length);
} finally {
  await security.close();
}
```

The SDK supports repository, path, committed-diff, and working-tree targets.
Use `security.preflight()` to validate local inputs, `onWorkerStatus` and
`onReconnect` to observe long-running scans, and an `AbortSignal` to cancel a
scan.

Successful results include open repository findings in `repositoryFindings`,
when available; `findings` remains the current scan. Matching earlier findings
can make one additional model call, including with a scan cost limit.

Results can contain source excerpts, vulnerability details, and reproduction
steps. Keep result directories and saved reports outside the repository and
limit access to authorized reviewers.

### SDK configuration and scan options

Pass runtime configuration to the `CodexSecurity` constructor:

| Option           | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pluginPath`     | Use a Codex Security plugin directory or ZIP instead of the bundled plugin. |
| `pythonPath`     | Select the Python interpreter before consulting `PYTHON`.                   |
| `codexOverrides` | Deep-merge supported settings into the isolated Codex configuration.        |

Pass scan configuration to `security.run(repository, options)` or
`security.preflight(repository, options)`:

| Option                  | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auth`                  | Select `"auto"`, `"chatgpt"`, or `"api-key"`.                                         |
| `target`                | Select a repository, repository-relative paths, committed diff, or working-tree diff. |
| `mode`                  | Select `"standard"` or `"deep"`; deep mode supports repositories and paths.           |
| `knowledgeBasePaths`    | Add architecture documents, security policies, threat models, or directories.         |
| `outputDir`             | Choose an artifact directory outside the enclosing Git worktree.                      |
| `archiveExisting`       | Archive results already in `outputDir` before starting a scan.                        |
| `maxCostUsd`            | Stop after the estimated model cost exceeds a positive USD amount.                    |
| `maxTimeHours`          | Limit deep-scan discovery to a positive number of hours, up to 96.                    |
| `failureSeverity`       | Record a finding-severity policy in the saved scan recipe.                            |
| `parentScanId`          | Link a rerun to an existing parent scan.                                              |
| `expectedPluginVersion` | Require the original plugin version when replaying a scan.                            |
| `signal`                | Cancel a scan with an `AbortSignal`.                                                  |

Progress and lifecycle callbacks are `onAuthentication`, `onCost`,
`onOutputArchived`, `onOutputDirReady`, `onScanStarted`,
`onTrustedAccessStatus`, `onReconnect`, `onSessionEvent`, `onWorkerStatus`,
`onWarning`, and `onObserverError`. `onSessionEvent` receives saved scan and
worker events with their thread IDs and worker numbers. Preflight does not start
the runtime, authenticate, resolve Python, inspect the plugin, or run those
scan-lifecycle callbacks.

## Authentication

For local use, sign in with ChatGPT:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security login
npx @openai/codex-security scan .
```

On a remote or headless machine, use device authentication:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security login --device-auth
```

For CI, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CODEX_API_KEY`. To store an API key instead,
pass it on stdin:

```bash
printenv OPENAI_API_KEY | npx @openai/codex-security login --with-api-key
```

Environment API keys are supplied directly to the current scan and are never
saved to the Codex credential home or system keyring. Only an explicit
`login --with-api-key` stores an API key.

To pass a Codex access token explicitly, use
`login --with-access-token` and provide the token on stdin. An access token
environment variable is not automatically used as a scan API key.

To use another inference provider, set its API key and select its provider:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="<your-openrouter-api-key>"
npx @openai/codex-security scan . --provider openrouter --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5

export FIREWORKS_API_KEY="<your-fireworks-api-key>"
npx @openai/codex-security scan . --provider fireworks --model accounts/fireworks/models/qwen3-235b-a22b

export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="<your-bedrock-api-key>"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-2"
npx @openai/codex-security scan . --provider amazon-bedrock --model openai.gpt-5.6-luna
```

On Windows, set the API key in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "<your-api-key>"
npx @openai/codex-security scan C:\code\repository
```

Check or remove the stored sign-in with `npx @openai/codex-security login status`
and `npx @openai/codex-security logout`. Codex Security keeps its sign-in in a
private, stable Codex home at `$CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR/codex-home`, or at
`$CODEX_HOME/state/plugins/codex-security/codex-home` when no state directory is
configured. On managed Windows devices, inherited access for `SYSTEM` and local
`Administrators` is preserved while protecting the home against future changes
to its parents. Other users and broad groups are rejected, and PowerShell
Constrained Language Mode is supported. Login,
status, logout, and scans use the same home. Codex manages
credentials using its configured file or system-keyring backend and honors
managed-device policies. An existing file-based Codex sign-in is imported only
when the dedicated home does not already contain stored credentials. Logging
out prevents later scans from automatically reimporting that ambient sign-in
until you explicitly log in again.

An environment API key takes precedence over a stored sign-in by default.
When both a stored ChatGPT sign-in and an environment API key are available, an
interactive scan asks which credential to use. JSON output, dry runs, CI, and
other noninteractive scans never prompt and retain automatic API-key
precedence. Select the credential source explicitly with `--auth`:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scan . --auth chatgpt
npx @openai/codex-security scan . --auth api-key
```

`--auth chatgpt` uses the stored sign-in and ignores `OPENAI_API_KEY` and
`CODEX_API_KEY`. `--auth api-key` requires one of those environment variables.
Omit `--auth`, or pass `--auth auto`, to preserve automatic API-key precedence
for existing CI and unattended scans. The SDK accepts the same selection as
`security.run(repository, { auth: "chatgpt" })` and
`security.preflight(repository, { auth: "chatgpt" })`.

To make the stored ChatGPT sign-in the automatic default instead, unset any
configured API-key variables:

```bash
unset OPENAI_API_KEY CODEX_API_KEY
```

The interactive choice applies only to the current scan and is not persisted.

When an environment key is configured, ChatGPT login and
`codex-security login status` identify the effective scan credential source
without printing its value, including when no stored sign-in exists.

```

Run `npx @openai/codex-security --version` for the installed CLI version or
`npx @openai/codex-security info --json` for the package, bundled plugin, Codex runtime,
default model, reasoning effort, and first-scan command. A scan with `--dry-run`
also reports its effective model and reasoning effort, including `--codex`
overrides, without starting Codex or contacting the network.

`install-hook` scans staged and unstaged changes before each commit. It respects
`core.hooksPath`, does not replace an existing hook, and blocks high-severity
findings or failed scans. Set `--fail-on-severity` to change the threshold.

`--path` scopes a scan to one or more paths, `--diff` scans committed changes,
and `--working-tree` scans staged and unstaged changes. Deep scans support
repository and path targets. The output directory must be outside the scanned
directory and any enclosing Git worktree. When SARIF is produced, it is written
to
`<scan-dir>/exports/results.sarif`.

Working-tree snapshots include files from untracked nested Git repositories.
Initialized submodules must be clean and checked out at the commit recorded by
the parent repository.

Repeat `--knowledge-base PATH` for multiple files or directories; `bulk-scan`
shares them with every repository. Directories are searched recursively for
Markdown, text, PDF, and Word (`.docx`) files.

### Configure deep scans

For `scan --mode deep`, `--workers` limits concurrent discovery workers,
`--subagents` controls each worker's subagents, `--stop-after-no-new` stops after
that many runs find no new issues, `--max-discovery-runs` limits total runs, and
`--max-time-hours` limits discovery duration. These options are also available
on SDK scans:

```ts
await security.run("/path/to/repository", {
  mode: "deep",
  workers: 2,
  subagents: 0,
  stopAfterNoNew: 3,
  maxDiscoveryRuns: 10,
  maxTimeHours: 1.5,
});
```

Set defaults in `~/.codex/codex-security/config.toml`, or under `$CODEX_HOME`
when it is configured. Explicit CLI and SDK settings override these defaults:

```toml
[deep_scan]
workers = 2
subagents = 0
stop_after_no_new = 3
max_discovery_runs = 10
max_time_hours = 1.5
```

The discovery deadline defaults to 96 hours. The configured value may be any
positive number, including fractional hours, up to 96. At the deadline,
in-flight discovery stops and completed findings are reduced and returned.
The 97-hour outer tool-call timeout reserves approximately one hour for final
reduction and result delivery, including at the 96-hour maximum.

`scan --workers` controls discovery workers within one deep scan;
`bulk-scan --workers` controls how many repositories are scanned concurrently.

On macOS/Linux, an existing output directory must be private to the current
user (`chmod 700`).

If the output directory already contains results, add `--archive-existing`.
The CLI moves them to `<output-dir>.previous-<timestamp>-<id>` and starts the
scan in a new, empty directory at the original path. Add `--dry-run` to see
the destination without moving files.

Scans are report-only by default. Use `--fail-on-severity` in CI to exit 1 when
a completed scan contains a finding at or above the selected severity.
Incomplete coverage and CLI/runtime errors exit 2 so they cannot be mistaken
for a passing policy. Incomplete scans still write the available human or JSON
result to stdout and a coverage warning to stderr, including in report-only
mode.

Use `--patch` to fix and verify confirmed findings after a complete scan.
`--patch-severity high` selects high and critical findings; the default is low
and above. After showing the findings summary, interactive scans with findings
ask whether to open a color-coded finding browser with complete finding details
and a separate patch-instructions panel. Use the arrow keys to
browse, `Tab` to inspect details, `Space` to select individual findings, `i` to
edit instructions for the focused finding, `1`–`4` to select by severity, and
`r` to optionally create a GitHub pull request after patching. Press `Enter` to
patch or `q` to keep the checkout unchanged. Each selected finding runs in its
own saved Codex desktop task. Add `--create-pr` to `scan --patch` or a
saved-finding `patch` command to commit only verified patch files and open a
pull request with `gh`. If the push or pull request fails, run the printed
`patch --resume-pr BRANCH` command from the same repository. It uses the saved
commit without running Codex again and refuses to publish if the branch changed.
JSON scan results include `patchSeverity`. Scan and
saved-finding results include one `patches` entry per selected finding with
status `verified`, `no_change`, `blocked`, or `failed`, plus `pullRequest` when
one is created. When `--fail-on-severity` is also set, verified and already-fixed
findings no longer fail the policy.

Scans use `gpt-5.6-sol` with extra-high reasoning effort by default. OpenAI is
the implied provider. Use `--model gpt-5.6-terra` to switch models and
`--effort minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max` to set reasoning effort. Repeat
`--codex KEY=VALUE` for other Codex settings; existing
`--codex 'model_reasoning_effort="high"'` overrides remain supported.

### Runtime configuration and worker limits

The standalone CLI and SDK do not load an unrelated user or repository Codex
configuration. Each scan starts with a private runtime and these Codex
defaults:

```toml
approval_policy = "on-request"
approvals_reviewer = "auto_review"
cli_auth_credentials_store = "auto"
model = "gpt-5.6-sol"
model_reasoning_effort = "xhigh"
model_reasoning_summary = "detailed"
show_raw_agent_reasoning = true

[features]
plugins = true
goals = true

[features.multi_agent_v2]
enabled = true
max_concurrent_threads_per_session = 9

[windows]
sandbox = "unelevated"
```

Use `--model` and `--effort` for model selection. Repeat
`--codex KEY=VALUE` to deep-merge other TOML values into this isolated
configuration:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scan . \
  --model gpt-5.6-terra \
  --effort high \
  --codex features.multi_agent_v2.max_concurrent_threads_per_session=4
```

The session thread limit includes the parent agent: the default of `9`
provides up to eight delegated worker slots. This limit is separate from
`bulk-scan --workers`, which controls how many repositories run concurrently.
A configured limit is a maximum, not evidence that every worker started.

Quote string values as TOML, for example
`--codex 'model_reasoning_effort="high"'`. Do not pass both `--model` and
`--codex 'model="..."'`, or both `--effort` and
`--codex 'model_reasoning_effort="..."'`: conflicting or repeated keys are
rejected.

Plugin and marketplace loading belong to Codex Security. Overrides of
`plugins`, `marketplaces`, or `features.plugins`, including profile-specific
plugin overrides, are rejected; choose `--plugin-path` instead. Native
multi-agent v2 must remain enabled. The legacy `agents.max_threads` setting
and `features.multi_agent_v2.enabled=false` are incompatible and rejected.
`validate` and `patch` accept `--effort` and only the `model` and
`model_reasoning_effort` `--codex` keys; they do not accept general scan
runtime overrides.

These overrides cannot replace the scanner-owned approval reviewer or
filesystem profile. Use `--codex 'approval_policy="never"'` to deny approval
requests instead of reviewing them automatically. See
[Local security model](#local-security-model).

### Deep-scan engine configuration

Deep scans read `$CODEX_HOME/codex-security/config.toml`, defaulting to
`~/.codex/codex-security/config.toml`:

```toml
[deep_scan]
workers = 4
subagents = 3
stop_after_no_new = 4
stop_after_consecutive_errors = 3
max_discovery_runs = 40
max_time_hours = 96
```

The default is four discovery workers; the legacy `workers = "auto"` setting
also resolves to four. Set `workers` to a positive integer to choose an explicit
count. `subagents` must be a nonnegative integer;
`stop_after_no_new`, `stop_after_consecutive_errors`, and `max_discovery_runs`
must be positive integers. `max_time_hours` must be a positive finite number no
greater than 96; fractional hours are supported. Unknown `[deep_scan]` keys are
rejected.

These settings are separate from Codex's
`features.multi_agent_v2.max_concurrent_threads_per_session` and
`bulk-scan --workers`. Standalone CLI and SDK scans create an isolated
`CODEX_HOME`, import the ambient `[deep_scan]` configuration, and apply explicit
CLI or SDK options on top. Set `stop_after_consecutive_errors` in the
configuration file. Use `--codex` to adjust the Codex session thread limit, not
to set `[deep_scan]` values.

### Environment variables

The CLI and SDK recognize the following user-configurable environment:

| Variable                                                                    | Effect                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CODEX_API_KEY`                                           | Scan authentication; `OPENAI_API_KEY` wins when both are present.                             |
| `CODEX_SECURITY_LINEAR_TEAM`, `CODEX_SECURITY_LINEAR_PROJECT`               | Default Linear team and project for completed-scan publication.                               |
| `CODEX_SECURITY_LINEAR_API_KEY`                                             | Patch Linear issues or publish directly with a personal API key.                              |
| `CODEX_SECURITY_LOG_LEVEL`                                                  | CLI-only; set to `debug` for verbose diagnostics.                                             |
| `LOG_LEVEL`                                                                 | CLI-only fallback when `CODEX_SECURITY_LOG_LEVEL` is unset.                                   |
| `CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR`                                                  | Override the private scan-history, workbench, and default artifact directory.                 |
| `CODEX_HOME`                                                                | Set the ambient Codex home for file-backed sign-in and default state; defaults to `~/.codex`. |

On Windows, `CODEX_CLI_PATH` must name a native `.exe` or `.com`. Command
shims such as `codex.cmd` automatically use the bundled Codex executable
instead.

Interpreter discovery uses `--python` or `pythonPath` first, then `PYTHON`,
the managed Codex runtime, and finally `python3` or `python` from `PATH` (`py`
is also supported on Windows).
`CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR` takes precedence over `CODEX_HOME`; keep both
state and result paths outside the scanned repository.

The repository's Docker Compose workflow additionally recognizes
`CODEX_SECURITY_IMAGE`, `CODEX_SECURITY_USER`, `CODEX_SECURITY_SECCOMP`,
`CODEX_SECURITY_CSV`, `CODEX_SECURITY_RESULTS`, and `CODEX_SECURITY_STATE` for
its image, runtime user, seccomp profile, input, results, and state mounts.
Provide `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` for private GitHub checkouts and
`CODEX_SECURITY_GIT_HOST` for a GitHub Enterprise host in the container.
These container settings are distinct from standalone CLI flags and
interactive discovery's `GH_HOST`.

Variables such as `CODEX_SECURITY_SCAN_ID`, `CODEX_SECURITY_SCAN_DIR`,
`CODEX_SECURITY_PLUGIN_ROOT`, `CODEX_SECURITY_CONFIG_PATH`, and
`CODEX_SECURITY_TARGET_PATHS_FILE` are generated by an active scan. They are
internal runtime data, not supported user configuration.

Use `--provider openrouter` to send inference through OpenRouter. Set
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and specify a supported model with `--model`.

Use `--provider fireworks` to send inference through Fireworks AI. Set
`FIREWORKS_API_KEY` and specify a supported model with `--model`.

Use `--provider amazon-bedrock` to send inference through Amazon Bedrock. Set
`AWS_REGION` and authenticate with `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, standard AWS
access keys, an AWS profile, web identity, container credentials, or the
default AWS credential chain. Specify a supported Bedrock model with `--model`;
OpenAI Bedrock models such as `openai.gpt-5.6-luna` support `--max-cost`.

Scan progress identifies the requested paths and reports actual ranking,
file-review, validation, and attack-path phases as they become available.
Interactive terminals show a full-screen view; CI, redirected output, and
`--headless` use plain timestamped progress lines.
Completion summarizes findings, severity, coverage, elapsed time, available
token and worker counts, estimated cost, the results directory, and the next
useful command.
Progress and summaries use stderr; structured scan results remain on stdout.

Add `--verbose` or set `CODEX_SECURITY_LOG_LEVEL=debug` to print
lifecycle, authentication, progress, and cost diagnostics to stderr.
`LOG_LEVEL=debug` is used only when `CODEX_SECURITY_LOG_LEVEL` is unset.
Structured JSON results remain on stdout. Review sensitive verbose logs before
sharing them. The normal activity feed hides credentials.

Each scan records its model, tokens, and estimated cost in its JSON result,
scan history, and bulk-scan receipt. Estimates use
[standard API token prices](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/compare),
including cached input and cache writes; fees and surcharges are not included.

Use `--max-cost USD` to stop a scan, including its delegated workers, when its
running cost exceeds the limit. If a Deep Scan has already finished discovery,
it returns a sealed partial report with any completed findings and lists
unvalidated candidates as follow-up work. Requests already in progress can
finish above the limit; preparing the partial report makes no additional model
requests. Incomplete coverage retains its existing exit code.
For `bulk-scan`, the limit applies separately to each repository attempt.

Run `npx @openai/codex-security scan --help` or `npx @openai/codex-security bulk-scan --help`
for the complete CLI references.

Sign in with `gh auth login`, then run `npx @openai/codex-security bulk-scan` to discover
GitHub repositories pushed in the last 90 days. Archived
repositories and forks are excluded. Search the repository list, select the
repositories to scan, and confirm before scanning.
Private checkouts reuse your GitHub CLI sign-in without changing your global Git
configuration. The selected repositories are saved to
`<output-dir>/repositories.csv` for review or resumption.

Interactive discovery accepts the same `--workers`, `--mode`, `--max-attempts`,
`--model`, `--effort`, `--plugin-path`, `--python`, and `--codex` settings as
CSV-driven scans. It prompts for the output directory; `--output-dir` is only
valid when a repository CSV is supplied.

To use an existing repository list or run in CI, pass a CSV with required `id`,
`repository`, and `revision` columns. Revisions must be full commit hashes;
optional `scope`, `mode`, and `prompt` columns customize individual scans:

```csv
id,repository,revision,scope,mode,prompt
service,https://github.com/acme/service.git,0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567,src,standard,Focus on authentication and authorization.
```

Use `--scan-prompt-file PATH` to add instructions to a scan or every bulk scan.
Bulk scans append each repository's CSV `prompt` after the shared instructions.
Use `--post-scan-prompt-file PATH` to run a follow-up in the same authenticated
session after each scan, including incomplete or failed scans. Canceled scans
and scans stopped at their configured cost limit do not start another turn.

`--workers` sets the number of concurrent repository scans and defaults to
`4`. `--max-attempts` sets how many times each pending repository can run per
invocation and defaults to `1`. Results remain under `--output-dir`; rerun the
same command to resume.

### Publish completed scans to Linear

Publish every finding from a completed standard, deep, or scoped scan to one
Linear team:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security publish scan /path/to/completed-scan \
  --to linear \
  --linear-team TEAM_ID
```

Add `--linear-project PROJECT_ID` to place the issues in a Linear project.
The existing `--project` flag remains an alias. Without a project, issues are
created directly in the selected team.

To choose from all completed scans saved in your local scan history, omit the
scan directory. The selector highlights each repository and shows its finding
count, relative run time, and abbreviated scan ID:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security publish scan \
  --to linear \
  --linear-team TEAM_ID
```

Destination flags take precedence over `CODEX_SECURITY_LINEAR_TEAM` and the
optional `CODEX_SECURITY_LINEAR_PROJECT`. Use `--dry-run` to preview the issue
titles without creating them, or `--json` to return structured publication
results.
Interactive publication shows a full-screen activity view with live Codex
output and issue-creation progress. Other terminals receive plain progress on
stderr, so `--json` output remains machine-readable.

By default, publishing starts Codex with your existing Codex configuration and
connected Linear app. Sign in to Codex and connect Linear before publishing in
this mode. No separate Linear API token is required, and publication does not
use the isolated Codex home created for security scans.

To publish directly through the Linear API without starting Codex, configure a
Linear personal API key:

```bash
export CODEX_SECURITY_LINEAR_API_KEY=YOUR_LINEAR_PERSONAL_API_KEY
npx @openai/codex-security publish scan /path/to/completed-scan \
  --to linear \
  --linear-team TEAM_ID
```

Direct API publication leaves issues unassigned by default. Pass
`--linear-assignee teammate@example.com` or `--linear-assignee USER_ID` to
assign the issues to a Linear user by email address or user ID.
`--linear-assignee` requires direct API publication.

You can also pass `--linear-api-key KEY`, which takes precedence over
`CODEX_SECURITY_LINEAR_API_KEY`. Prefer the environment variable to avoid
exposing your API key in shell history and process listings. API keys are not
added to successful publication results, scan history, or sealed scan artifacts.
Error messages are preserved as returned. `--dry-run` never contacts Linear in
either mode.

Each finding creates a separate new issue titled
`[Codex Security][HIGH] Finding title`. The issue includes the scan ID,
repository, scanned scope, source locations and code snippets, severity,
confidence, vulnerability classification, summary, and remediation guidance.
Verified immutable Git revisions include source links. Findings are published
concurrently in batches of up to 20. Successful issue identifiers are linked
to their findings in the local scan-history database, and structured results
are read back from that database rather than generated by Codex. The completed
scan must already exist in the local scan history. Running publication again
creates another set of issues for the same scan; existing issues are not
matched, updated, or reused.

Issue descriptions contain source code and vulnerability details. Select a
Linear destination authorized to receive that information. Publication receipts
are stored separately from the sealed scan artifacts.

You can also publish a scan from TypeScript:

```ts
import { publishScan } from "@openai/codex-security";

const publication = await publishScan("/path/to/completed-scan", {
  destination: "linear",
  teamId: "TEAM_ID",
  onProgress: (progress) => {
    if (progress.type === "issue_completed") {
      console.error(
        `Processed ${progress.completed} of ${progress.total} findings.`,
      );
    }
  },
});

console.log(publication.scanId);
console.log(publication.created.length);
```

Add `projectId: "PROJECT_ID"` to the options to publish into a specific Linear
project instead of directly to the team.

Pass `linearApiKey` to publish directly through the Linear API. Omit
`assigneeId` to leave issues unassigned, or supply a Linear user ID or email
address to select an assignee:

```ts
const directPublication = await publishScan("/path/to/completed-scan", {
  destination: "linear",
  teamId: "TEAM_ID",
  linearApiKey: process.env["CODEX_SECURITY_LINEAR_API_KEY"],
  assigneeId: "teammate@example.com",
});
```

### Scan history and reruns

`scans` or `scans list` lists scans for the current repository. Pass a repository
path to inspect another checkout, or `--scan-root DIR` to list scans whose
artifacts are under a particular root. `scans show` opens the latest completed
scan for the current repository. Pass `SCAN_ID` to inspect another scan. Scan
details include the configuration, results, coverage, and artifact locations. Add
`--show-linked-findings` to include finding links from previous scans.

`scans logs` shows session events from the latest scan, including an active scan.
Pass `SCAN_ID` to select another scan. During a scan, press `d` for live details.
Filter with `a` for all sources, `m` for the main scan, or `1`–`9` for a worker.
Logs and live details can contain source code and credentials.

Every scan history command accepts a full scan ID or a unique prefix of at
least eight characters.

Scan history uses `$CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR/workbench.sqlite3` when
`CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR` is set. Otherwise, it uses
`$CODEX_HOME/state/plugins/codex-security/workbench.sqlite3`; `CODEX_HOME`
defaults to `~/.codex`. Scan credentials are never stored in the scan
configuration. Recorded failure summaries and bulk-scan receipts omit messages
that contain recognizable credentials.

The scan sandbox permits writes to the selected state directory so SQLite can
maintain its database and journal files. If the host itself cannot write to the
default directory, select a writable directory outside the scanned repository:

```bash
export CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR=/path/to/writable/codex-security-state
```

`findings` or `findings list` lists open findings for the current repository.
Use `findings false-positive OCCURRENCE_ID --reason TEXT` to mark a finding as a
false positive and explain why. Later scans dismiss a matching finding only when
the same reason still applies.

`scans rerun` repeats the latest completed scan against the current checkout.
Pass `SCAN_ID` to rerun another scan.

`scans match BEFORE_SCAN_ID AFTER_SCAN_ID` links findings with the same root
cause; `scans match --all` matches all completed scans of the current repository,
including other worktrees and clones. Saved matches appear in `scans show` and
are reused unless `--force` is passed. Scans without sealed artifacts are skipped.

`scans compare` compares the two latest completed scans. Pass one scan ID to
compare it with the latest completed scan, or two IDs to select both scans. It
matches findings by root cause, reuses saved matches, and reports findings as
new, persisting, reopened, resolved, or unknown. Missing findings are not
treated as resolved when the later scan is incomplete or does not cover their
original scope.

The CLI uses [Incur](https://github.com/wevm/incur) for agent-friendly discovery
and structured output. Inspect the command manifest with `--llms`, inspect a
command schema with `scan --schema --format json`, register the CLI as an MCP
server with `mcp add`, sync agent skills with `skills add`, or generate shell
completions with `completions bash|zsh|fish`. Scan results support
`--format toon|json|yaml|jsonl` and `--full-output`.
Use `info --json` for SDK and bundled-plugin metadata. MCP exposes only this
read-only metadata command; scans, bulk repository scans,
authentication, exports, validation, and patching remain CLI-only because the
MCP transport cannot cancel active scans.

For CI, save machine-readable output outside the checked-out repository and
apply a severity policy. Incomplete coverage and runtime errors still exit
nonzero:

```bash
SCAN_ROOT="$(mktemp -d)"
npx @openai/codex-security scan . \
  --diff origin/main \
  --output-dir "$SCAN_ROOT/results" \
  --json \
  --fail-on-severity high > "$SCAN_ROOT/findings.json"
```

JSON scans never use interactive terminal controls, even when stderr is a TTY.
Saved-finding patch commands support `--json`; literal issue and file patch
commands do not. The `validate`, `login`, and `logout` commands reject `--json`.
Sign-in commands remain interactive. CSV exports cannot be written to stdout
while JSON output is requested.

Use `export` to create CSV, JSON, or SARIF from a completed, sealed scan without
starting Codex or loading credentials. Without a scan directory, it exports the
latest completed scan for the current repository. JSON preserves the sealed findings
document. CSV uses the portable findings columns, marks findings as open, and
does not include local workbench triage state. The exporter validates the seal
before writing, accepts `--output -` for stdout, and can use
`--source-root /path/to/repository` with SARIF to add source-line fingerprints.
Run `npx @openai/codex-security export --help` for all export options.

Use `validate` to run the bundled validation skill on candidate findings and
`patch` to run the bundled fix-finding skill on security issues. Each positional
input can be either a file, whose contents are read into the request, or literal
text. These inputs operate on the current directory. Pass a saved finding or
occurrence ID instead to patch its original repository, or use
`patch --scan SCAN_ID --severity high` for high and critical findings from one
scan. `--scan latest` selects the most recent scan of the current repository.
Saved-finding patch commands accept `--json` and return a verified, already
fixed, blocked, or failed result for each finding. Both commands use the scan
model and reasoning defaults and disable plugins. Patching starts a separate
saved task in the Codex desktop app for each finding. Override the model with
`--codex 'model="gpt-5.6-sol"'` and the
reasoning effort with `--effort high` or
`--codex 'model_reasoning_effort="high"'`.

Use `patch --linear-issue ISSUE` to import a Linear issue by identifier or URL.
Repeat `--linear-issue` to include more issues. Use
`patch --linear-project "PROJECT"` to patch every open issue in a project. Add
`--linear-filter '{"labels":{"name":{"eq":"security"}}}'` to apply a native
Linear issue filter on the server. Completed and canceled issues are excluded
unless the filter explicitly sets `state`. Set `CODEX_SECURITY_LINEAR_API_KEY`
for a personal API key, or `LINEAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` for an OAuth access token.
`LINEAR_API_KEY` is also accepted. `--linear-api-key KEY` overrides these
environment settings; prefer the environment variable to keep keys out of shell
history. Imported content is always literal, and issue URLs must match the
selected workspace. Linear access is read-only, and its credentials are not
passed to the patch subprocess.

Exit codes are `0` for a completed report-only scan or a passing policy, `1`
for a completed policy violation, `2` for invalid input, incomplete coverage, or
a runtime/export error, `130` for interruption, and `143` for termination.

Use `--dry-run` or `await security.preflight(...)` to validate the repository,
target, mode, output location, and Codex overrides without initializing the
runtime or loading credentials. Dry runs do not inspect the plugin or probe its
Python interpreter. The preflight result includes the selected authentication
method and, for an environment API key, its variable name. Authentication and
model access remain unverified until a real scan starts.

Scan progress identifies the selected credential source before Codex starts.
Terminals and noninteractive CI logs also show how to retry with
`--auth chatgpt` when an environment API key overrides the stored sign-in.
Progress remains on stderr so JSON output stays machine readable. Network
failures and rate limits remain retryable; definitive authentication and model
authorization failures stop immediately.

## Containerized bulk scans

Create `repositories.csv` with one full, immutable Git commit per repository:

```csv
id,repository,revision
payments,https://github.com/example/payments.git,0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
```

Once the approved image has been published, prepare private results and
authentication directories, sign in, and run the Docker Compose configuration
from the root of the Codex Security repository:

```bash
mkdir -p results state
chmod 700 results state
export CODEX_SECURITY_USER="$(id -u):$(id -g)"
export CODEX_SECURITY_IMAGE=ghcr.io/openai/codex-security:latest
docker compose pull codex-security
docker compose run --rm codex-security login --device-auth
docker compose run --rm codex-security
```

Reports and resumable scan results are written to `results/`; the reusable
device login remains in `state/`. For unattended scans, set `OPENAI_API_KEY`
or `CODEX_API_KEY` instead. Set `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` for private
GitHub repositories.

The container accepts the repository CSV before or after bulk-scan options.
Interactive repository discovery remains disabled, including when global CLI
options appear before `bulk-scan`.

On Ubuntu hosts that restrict unprivileged user namespaces, an administrator
can install the optional, narrowly scoped AppArmor profile once:

```bash
sudo install -m 0644 docker/codex-security.apparmor /etc/apparmor.d/codex-security-container
sudo apparmor_parser -r -W /etc/apparmor.d/codex-security-container
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.apparmor.yaml run --rm codex-security
```

The override preserves the nonroot user, dropped capabilities,
no-new-privileges, and hardened seccomp policy. Other Docker hosts do not need
the profile or override.

## Local security model

Codex Security runs with your local operating-system permissions. Scan only
repositories you trust and either own or are authorized to assess. Your
repository, Git installation, configured tools, and other scans under the
same account are not separate security principals.

Every scan uses the `codex_security_scan` filesystem profile and
automatically reviewed execution approvals. Its baseline profile allows reads
of the local filesystem and writes to workspace roots and the selected scan
state directory. Approval requests are reviewed without an interactive prompt;
approved requests can grant additional permissions for a specific operation.
Use `--codex 'approval_policy="never"'` or a selected profile with that policy
to deny all requests instead. Other `approval_policy`, `approvals_reviewer`,
`sandbox_mode`, or permission overrides cannot replace the reviewer or baseline
filesystem profile. Saved scans retain their effective approval policy; older
saved scans remain deny-all when rerun. Independently enforced host and network
restrictions still apply.

Scan and workbench subprocesses can inherit your environment, including
unrelated API tokens and cloud credentials. Start a scan with only the
credentials it needs.

The scanner must stay within the target and output paths you authorize and
must not disclose private data beyond the operation you requested. Its results
must accurately report the scan mode, reviewed files, and exclusions. Consult
the security policy for the full threat model and private reporting process.
